# Fine-Tune-Flan-T5-Model-for-Dialogue-Summarization
In this notebook, the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face will be fine-tuned for dialogue summarization. Full fine-tuning will be performed and evaluated using ROUGE metrics. Then, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) will be applied to show its benefits despite slightly lower performance metrics.
